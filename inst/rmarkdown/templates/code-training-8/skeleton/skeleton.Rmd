## Your Simulate Dataset Function

Put your custom `sim.dataset` here.

```{r}

```

## Your Power Function

Put your `simulate.power` here.

```{r}

```

## Your Possible Scenarios

Put the code for your `all_scenarios`, `sim_study_output`, and your for loop over all the scenarios here.

```{r}



```

## Data Wrangling

We ultimately want both tests' results on the same plot instead of two separate ones. To do this, you need to reformat your data. See `pivot_wider` and/or `pivot_longer` [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/tidyr.pdf) for more details.

It may also be helpful to read [Chapter 3 through section 3.6](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and [Chapter 12 through Section 12.3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).


```{r}
## reformat your sim_study_output
pivot.data <- 
```

## Updated Plots

I have outlined the plots that will help you display your simulation study results with both test results displayed on the same plot. Go through this code carefully, make sure you understand what is being displayed, and fill in the labels to be informative. If you have more than four levels of your parameter, you will need to update the colors as well. Ask me for help if you need it.

```{r}
ggplot(subset(pivot.data, param1 == param2), aes(x = sample_size, y = power, col = interaction(test_type, param1), lty = interaction(test_type, param1), group = interaction(test_type, param1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "", y = "") + ## TO DO: FIX THIS LABEL TO BE INFORMATIVE
  ggtitle("") + ## TO DO: FIX THIS LABEL TO BE INFORMATIVE
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Simulation Conditions", values = rep(c("red", "red", "orange", "orange", "green", "green", "blue", "blue"), times = 2)) +
  scale_linetype_manual(name = "Simulation Conditions", values = rep(c(1, 2), times = 4)) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(3, "line"))

ggplot(subset(pivot.data, param1 != param2), aes(x = sample_size, y = power, col = interaction(test_type, param1), lty = interaction(test_type, param1), group = interaction(test_type, param1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "", y = "") + ## TO DO: FIX THIS LABEL TO BE INFORMATIVE
  ggtitle("") + ## TO DO: FIX THIS LABEL TO BE INFORMATIVE
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Simulation Conditions", values = rep(c("red", "red", "orange", "orange", "green", "green", "blue", "blue"), times = 2)) +
  scale_linetype_manual(name = "Simulation Conditions", values = rep(c(1, 2), times = 4)) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(3, "line"))

```

## Deliverables

Submit your R Markdown document and knitted file to Moodle as:

LastName-CT-08.Rmd 

LastName-CT-08.html

To get these files onto your own computer, look in the "Files" pane in the bottom right. Check the boxes next to the two files you want to export, click the "More" button (with a little blue gear), click "Export". Make sure you are exporting the files to a place where you can find them on your own computer. 

*Due*: Monday, April 18th before class
