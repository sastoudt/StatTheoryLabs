## Question 1

In this question we will focus on understanding the bootstrap at a high level and use a pre-existing implementation of it.

Consider a population that has a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha = 5$ and $\beta =4$. Recall that the gamma function in R requires the parameterization $1/\beta$ (see the "Help" if you do not know what I mean by this).

**a.)** Describe the approximate sampling distribution for the mean shown below.

```{r}
n <- 200
xbars <- rep(NA, n)

for (i in 1:n) {
  dat <- rgamma(n, 5, 1 / 4)
  xbars[i] <- mean(data)
}

xbars <- data.frame(x = xbars)

ggplot(xbars, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal()

```



**b.)** Take a sample from the population described in part a. Find the mean and standard deviation of this sample.

```{r}
n <- 
samp <- rgamma(n =  ___, ___, ___)

mean(___)
sd(___)
```

There is a package in R that implements the bootstrap for many different scenarios called `infer`. Use it to find the bootstrap mean and standard error of the bootstrap distribution for your sample.

```{r}
samp <- data.frame(x = samp)
boot_dist <- samp %>%
  specify(response = x) %>%
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

head(boot_dist) ## make sure you understand what is stored here

visualize(boot_dist) ## make sure you understand what is being plotted here


mean(___$stat)
sd(___$stat)
```

**c.)** Compare the bootstrap distribution to the approximate sampling distribution by answering the following questions:

- What is the population mean and standard deviation? (no code)

- What is the sample mean and standard deviation?

```{r}

```

- What is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$? (no code)

- What is the mean and standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution of $\bar{X}$?

```{r}

```

**d.)** Adjust the sample size to $n=10$ and compare the bootstrap distribution to the approximate sampling distribution by answering the following questions.

- What is the population mean and standard deviation? (no code)

- What is the sample mean and standard deviation?

```{r}
n <- 
samp <- rgamma(n =  ___, ___, ___)

mean(___)
sd(___)
```

- What is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$? (no code)

- What is the mean and standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution of $\bar{X}$?

```{r}
samp <- data.frame(x = samp)
boot_dist <- samp %>%
  specify(response = x) %>%
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

visualize(boot_dist)

mean(___$stat)
sd(___$stat)
```

**e.)** What is the effect of sample size on the bootstrap distribution?


## Question 2

Now we will code the bootstrap ourselves instead of relying on infer. Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \sim^{iid} N(\mu, 1)$ and $\theta = e^\mu$. Consider $\hat{\theta}_n$. 

**a.)** Create a data set named `xs` of $n = 100$ observations from the above distribution using $\mu = 5$.

```{r }
n <- 
xs <- rnorm(n= , mean = , sd = )
xs <- data.frame (x = xs)

```

**b.)** What is the general form of the plug-in estimator of $\theta$? (not a code question) What is the estimate of $\hat{\theta}_n$ based on your data? (is a code question)

```{r}

```

**c.)** Based on the pseudocode we wrote in class build your bootstrap distribution of $\hat{\theta}_n$ ($B = 10000$).

Hint: Check out the help for the function `exp`.

```{r}
B <- ___

theta_hat_n_boot <- ___ ## create a place to store the value of theta_hat_n (you may want to refer to the loops examples, reposted on Moodle)

for(i in 1:___){
  ## draw a random resample of size n with replacement from our original sample xs 
  
  ## compute your statistic theta_hat_n from the resample
  
  ## store your statistic in the ith spot in theta_hat_n_boot
}

hist(___) ## plot the bootstrap distribution

```


**d.)** Use this distribution to get $se_{boot}$ and three 95% confidence intervals for $\theta$ (normal interval, bootstrap percentile interval, bootstrap pivotal interval). You may want to check out the help page for the `quantile` function.

```{r}
se_boot <- ___

normal_interval <- ___

bootstrap_percentile_interval <- ___

bootstrap_pivotal_interval <- ___

```


**e.)** Plot a histogram of the bootstrap replications and describe the distribution. This is the bootstrap distribution of $\hat{\theta}_n$. Try using `ggplot` this time.

```{r}

```

**f.)** Plot a histogram of the 'true' sampling distribution and describe the distribution. Hint: The sampling distribution is defined as the distribution of $\hat{\theta}_n$ calculated from every possible sample of the same size from the population. For simplicity, build the sampling distribution using 10000 random samples from the population (not from the original sample). 

```{r}


```

**g.)** Compare the two distributions. In words what do you see in terms of shape, center, and spread. Remember that unless you have specified using `xlim()` and `ylim()` in `ggplot` or the `xlim` and `ylim` options in `hist` your plots may not have directly comparable axis. 

## Question 3 - The bootstrap standard error

In this exercise, we will investigate how accurate the bootstrap estimate of the standard error is when the sample size is small.

Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \sim_{iid} N(\theta, 1)$. The plug-in estimate of $\theta$ is $\hat{\theta}_n = \bar{X}$. 

**a.)** Find an exact expression for the standard error of $\hat{\theta}_n$ and call this $se$. (not a code question) 

**b.)** Now take $\theta = 0$, $n=5$ and conduct a simulation. In this simulation, you will create 100 bootstrap distributions. Each time you simulate a bootstrap distribution, estimate the standard error. To keep this manageable, use B = 200 in the bootstrap and use 100 simulations. You will then get 100 bootstrap standard errors, $se_1, ..., se_{100}$. Hint: This will require a double for loop, with the outer loop for the 100 simulations and the inner loop for computing the 200 bootstrap replications.

```{r}
B <- ___ ## number of times to resample in one bootsrap procedure
num_sims <- ___ ## number of times to repeat the bootstrap
n <- ## sample size
  
std_err_ests <- ____ ## create space to store results 

xs <- ## generate original sample from the population

for(j in 1:___){
  
  theta_hat_n_boot <- ## create space to store bootstrap results
  for(i in 1:___){
     ## draw a random resample of size n with replacement from our original sample xs 
  
  ## compute your statistic theta_hat_n from the resample
  
  ## store your statistic in the ith spot in theta_hat_n_boot
  }
  ## compute standard error of bootstrap distribution
  ## store result in jth place in std_err_ests
}

hist() ## plot the distribution of standard error estimates
```

**c.)** To assess the accuracy of the bootstrap, compute the mean of $\frac{|se_1 - se|}{se}, ... \frac{|se_{100} - se|}{se}$. What is your conclusion about the accuracy of the bootstrap standard error?

```{r}
true_se <- ## put the value you determined in a here

mean(abs(std_err_ests - true_se))
```

**d.)** Repeat for $n=50$ and comment on the accuracy.

```{r}
n <- ## sample size
  
std_err_ests <- ____ ## create space to store results 

## this loop code shouldn't change from what you did in b
for(j in 1:___){
  
  theta_hat_n_boot <- ## create space to store bootstrap results
  for(i in 1:___){
     ## draw a random resample of size n with replacement from our original sample xs 
  
  ## compute your statistic theta_hat_n from the resample
  
  ## store your statistic in the ith spot in theta_hat_n_boot
  }
  ## compute standard error of bootstrap distribution
  ## store result in jth place in std_err_ests
}

hist() ## plot the distribution of standard error estimates
```

```{r}
true_se <- ## put the value you determined in a here

mean(abs(std_err_ests - true_se))
```

##  Question 4: Two-sample bootstrap

In general, bootstrapping sampling should mimic how the data were sampled. For example, if the data correspond to independent samples from two distinct populations, we should draw two samples in that way. With the two resamples, we proceed by computing the statistic comparing the resamples, as we normally would, such as difference in means or proportions. The `infer` package as of now, actually does not implement their two-sample bootstrap this way (see [here](https://github.com/tidymodels/infer/issues/245)), so we would need to code it from scratch to make it happen.

Here is the pseudocode for this type of bootstrap:

1. Draw a resample of size $m$ with replacement from the first sample and a separate resample of size $n$ from the second sample. 

2. Compute a statistic that compares the two groups.

3. Repeat this resampling process $B$ times.

4. Construct the bootstrap distribution of the statistic.

Hint: This all happens in a single loop.

**a.)** The data set `IceCream` (provided on Moodle) contains calorie information for a sample of brands of chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Use a 95% bootstrap percentile interval to determine whether or not there is a difference in the average number of calories. Include a histogram of your bootstrap distribution.

```{r}
## read in IceCream.csv

## look at what columns you have access too
```

```{r}
B <- ___
n <- nrow(___) ## how many samples do you have in your data

theta_hat_n_boot <- ___ ## create a place to store the value of theta_hat_n (you may want to refer to the loops examples, reposted on Moodle)

for(i in 1:___){
  ## now we want to resample both the vanilla calories and the chocolate calories
  vanilla_samp <-
  chocolate_samp <-
  
  ## compute your statistic theta_hat_n, it will involve a summary of both vanilla_samp and chocolate_samp
  
  ## store your statistic in the ith spot in theta_hat_n_boot
}

hist(___) ## plot the bootstrap distribution

```

**b.)** Would you expect the 95% bootstrap normal interval to be similar to that in (a)? Why or why not?
